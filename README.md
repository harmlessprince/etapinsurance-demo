# InsuranceTech API
Welcome to a Simple Insurance API â€“ a backend service that helps manage agents, insurance policies, commissions, and payout requests. It models the critical workflow from policy sales by agents to commission earnings and payout management.
## Overview

The API provides the following functionalities:

1. Tracks insurance policies sold by agents.
2. Calculates commissions earned by agents based on policies.
3. Provides a breakdown of earnings by policy type.
4. Allows agents to request payouts based on available commissions.
5. Supports filtering of policies by type for easy reporting.

## Key Features

1. Policy Management: Agents can sell third-party or comprehensive insurance policies.
2. Commission Tracking: Commissions are automatically associated with policies.
3. Earnings Breakdown: View total earnings, earnings from the last 30 days, and categorized breakdown by policy type.
4. Payout Requests: Agents can request payouts for their commissions, which deducts from the available balance.
5. Database-Level Aggregation: Calculations such as total earned, recent earnings, and policy breakdowns are done using raw SQL for performance.
6. Model Relationships: Establish strong relationships between users, policies, commissions, and vehicles.
